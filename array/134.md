# Intuition
First idea is to check if the sum of gas is greater than or equal to the sum of cost. If it is, then there must be a solution.

The point I struggle the most is how to find the start index. Initially, I tried calculating difference of gas and cost, finding the start index by grouping the negative sum of gas - cost and the positive sum of gas - cost, returning the start index of the positive group. However, this bring me to a dead end because some of the cases had a edge group wrapping around the vector. As a result, I had a mental breakdown.😭

After recovering from the breakdown, I realized that "check if the sum of gas is greater than or equal to the sum of cost" eliminates the all the cases with no solution.

The presenting solution is a very elegant one. It is a one-pass solution, keeping track of the sum of gas - cost. If the sum is negative, set start index to the next index and reset the sum. The start index is the answer.

# Approach
1. If the sum of gas is less than the sum of cost, then there is no solution.
2. If the sum of gas is greater than or equal to the sum of cost, then there must be a solution.
3. Keep track of the sum of gas - cost.
4. If the sum is negative, reset it and update the start index.
5. Return the start index.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:$$O(n)$$
where $$n$$ is the length of the input vector.
Note: accumulate() is a linear time operation.

- Space complexity:$$O(1)$$

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int> &gas, vector<int> &cost)
    {
        if (gas.size() == 1) {
            return gas[0] >= cost[0] ? 0 : -1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            gas[i] -= cost[i];
        }
        if (accumulate(gas.begin(), gas.end(), 0) < 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            sum += gas[i];
            if (sum < 0) {
                sum = 0;
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
};
