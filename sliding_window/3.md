# Intuition
The problem is about finding the longest substring without repeating characters. To solve this, we can use a sliding window approach to keep track of the current substring and a hash map to store the last seen index of each character.

# Approach
1. Use a sliding window technique with two pointers: `start` and `i`. The `start` pointer marks the beginning of the current substring, while `i` iterates through the string.
2. Use an unordered map (`hash`) to store the last index of each character encountered.
3. For each character at index `i`, check if it exists in the map and if its stored index is greater than or equal to `start`. If so, move the `start` pointer to one position after the last occurrence of that character.
4. Update the maximum length of the substring if the current substring length (`i - start + 1`) is greater.
5. Update the character's index in the map.
6. Return the maximum length found.

The reason why hash map is used instead of a set is to keep track of the last occurrence of each character. This allows us to move the `start` pointer to the correct position directly when a repeating character is found rather than iterating through the substring to find the last occurrence.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice: once when expanding the window and once when moving the start pointer.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is $$O(min(n, m))$$, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters). The map stores each unique character in the substring.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(std::string s) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> hash; // Hash map to store the last index of each character
        int max_length = 0; // Variable to store the maximum length of the substring
        int start = 0; // Pointer to mark the start of the substring
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s[i];
            // If the character is found in the hash map and start is less than or equal to its last position
            if (hash.find(c) != hash.end() && start <= hash[c]) {
                start = hash[c] + 1; // Move the start to the position after the last occurrence of the character
            } else {
                max_length = std::max(max_length, i - start + 1); // Update the maximum length
            }
            hash[c] = i; // Update the last occurrence of the character
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

```python []
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        hash_map = {}  # Dictionary to store the last index of each character
        max_length = 0  # Variable to store the maximum length of the substring
        start = 0  # Pointer to mark the start of the substring

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            # If the character is found in the hash map and start is less than or equal to its last position
            if c in hash_map and start <= hash_map[c]:
                start = hash_map[c] + 1  # Move the start to the position after the last occurrence of the character
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)  # Update the maximum length

            hash_map[c] = i  # Update the last occurrence of the character

        return max_length
```
